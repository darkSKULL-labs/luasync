now = event.wait(timeout, catch)

this call will wait for all events for specified timeout. 'catch' points to a function
which is called when there is error raised, its arguments are:
catch(obj, ...)
if it returns true, the event.wait() loop is prematurely interrupted.

return value is number of events processed.
