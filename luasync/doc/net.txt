Net interface
-------------

network socket constructors are net.tcp and net.udp, they return a table with the following structure:
s.fd = real file descriptor number
s.error = error on the socket
s.read, s.write = set to true if youre interested in read/write events on this socket
s.cb = callback to be called/resumed (either function or a thread) when there is an event on the socket
cb is called like:
cb(s, read, write) where read and write are booleans if the event happened

s = net.tcp([bindaddr,port])
	create a tcp socket

s = net.udp([bindaddr,port])
	create an udp socket

failed = net.nonblock(s, boolean)
	true = nonblocking mode, false = blocking mode (default)

failed = net.bind(s, bindaddr, port)
	bind socket to addr/port. returns false if failed

failed = net.listen(s[,backlog])
	start listening to a socket. returns false if failed

val = net.opt(s, "reuseaddr|keepalive|linger|sndbuf|rcvbuf|sndlowat|rcvlowat|sndtimeo|rcvtimeo"[, value])
	set or get socket option. if no value specified the option's value is just returned

host, port = net.peername(s[,newhost,newport])
	get remote peer's name.
	for udp sockets you can also set fixed remote peer (udp "connect()") by providing two arguments
	host/port.

s, host, port = net.accept(s)
	accept incoming connection

s = net.connect(s,host,port)
	connect to remote host port. for tcp it starts the connection, for udp
	it just sets fixed remote peer name (equal to net.peername)

count = net.recv(s, buf, count)
	try to receive count bytes into buffer buf. returns number of bytes received,
	or nil on error.
count, host, port = net.recvfrom(buf, s, count)
	same as recv, but for unconnected udp sockets.

count = net.send(s, buf)
	try to send as many bytes of the buffer buf as possible. returns number of bytes sent,
	or nil on error.

count = net.sendto(s, buf, host, port)
	same as above, but again for connectionless udp sockets.

	net.close(s)
	close the socket.
